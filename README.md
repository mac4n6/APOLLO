# Apple Pattern of Life Lazy Output'er (APOLLO)
* Originally presented as the first ever [Objective by the Sea](https://objectivebythesea.com/) - Mac Security Conference in 2018
* Presentation Slides: [From Apple Seeds to Apple Pie](https://github.com/mac4n6/Presentations/tree/master/From%20Apple%20Seeds%20to%20Apple%20Pie)

# BETA - FOR TESTING PURPOSES ONLY
* This is your warning. I've tested a few modules but there is much more testing to be done.
* Find a bug or a better query, let me know!
* Extra warning on PowerLog modules, timestamps may be in the past and/or future - testing these.
* Many more modules to come!
* Python 2.7, probably doesn't run on 3 without tweaking code.

## Usage
`python apollo.py -o {csv, sql} -p {ios, mac, yolo} -v {8,9,10,11,12,yolo} <modules directory> <data directory>`

## Output Options (-o)
* csv - CSV
* sql - SQLite Database

## Platform Options (-p)
* `ios`
* `mac` [Offical support coming soon!]
* `yolo` - Just parse whatever.

## Version Options (-v)
* iOS `8`, `9`, `10`, `11`, `12`
* `yolo` - Just parse whatever.

## Getting Errors? Try This (Windows users, use eqivlent commands)
* Check database permissions - Use `chmod` to give some databases with "all blank" permissions some sort of permission. (Happens with many types of physical-logical extractions.)
* Check database ownership - Use `chown` to take ownership of the files.

## Data Directory Pro Tip
* ~~Extract databases as it will take forever (1hr+) to run on full disk dump, it works, but be patient.~~
* Not anymore, thanks to Sam Alptekin of @sjc_CyberCrimes 👍
